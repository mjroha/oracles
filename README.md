# Oracles

This is just a simple web-app that randomly chooses and displays messages, intended to serve as inspiration for roleplaying games or fiction. See it in action -- either [In A Wicked Age][SITE_IAWA] or [Itras By][SITE_ITRAS].

There are a lot of these already (check out [Chaotic Shiny][SHINY] and [Abulafia][ABULAFIA]), and there's nothing especially novel about this one; it's just that the existing ones display very bare-bones HTML, but I wanted one that's as lovely as the books that inspired it.

There are already [two][ORACLE1] [different][ORACLE2] perfectly functional web implementations of these oracles -- as I said, mine is nothing novel -- but I wanted to add a few things...

## Features

* It's pretty! I've tried to follow the designs of the books (q.v.) without aping them exactly. I used free fonts from [Google Web Fonts][GWF] and backgrounds from [Eos][EOS].
* It looks pretty good on an iPhone, using the special `viewport` meta tag. (I'm not sure how it looks on Android or other mobile devices; let me know if it can be improved.)
* On iOS it's optimized for being saved to the home screen. It's got a custom icon and it opens up full-screen. (It doesn't yet run offline, though.)
* It's 100% client-side code, so you can run it on any web server or even on your local disk, without needing PHP or anything else.

## Source Books

### In A Wicked Age

Vincent Baker's **_[In A Wicked Age][IAWA]_** is a dark fantasy sword-and-sorcery roleplaying game focused on storytelling. An integral part of the game is its four "Oracles": before each session the group draws four cards from one of these and uses the characters, locations and situations they describe.

### Itras By

[Itras By][ITRASBY] is a surreal role-playing game by Ole Peder Giæver and Martin Bull Gudmundsen, which takes place in the vaguely-1920s, vaguely-Nordic setting of the eponymous city. The game doesn't use dice; instead, decisions are resolved by drawing cards.

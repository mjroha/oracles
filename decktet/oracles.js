        "text": "The Darkness can settle on familiar places and hides all manner of things.\nAlthough one may hide there or seek for what is lost there, it is best not to tarry there too long.\nUnlike the Cave, it is sometimes best to illuminate and dispel the Darkness rather than to flee from it."
    },
